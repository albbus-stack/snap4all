<h2>How it works</h2>
To finalize the installation of Snap4all the device must be restarted.

Once restarted, the new features installed will be shown in this menu.

Without restarting you can use the Termux Console or read the Information.

-> If the Termux Console is disabled please check your internet connection, then close and reopen the app before restart.


<ul>
	<li>If you want to open the termux console simply click on 'Termux Console'.
	<li>If you want to open IOT APP EDITOR, when it is enabled, simply click on 'IOT APP EDITOR'.
	<li>If you want to open the IOT APP DASHBOARD, when it is enabled, simply click on 'DASHBOARD'.
</ul>
<p>The IOT APP EDITOR and DASHBOARD buttons are enabled and visible only after the Node-RED server starts up.
<br>
</p>
<h2>Example of use</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Install the application.
	<li>Reboot your phone.
	<li>Open the application.
	<li>Click on IOT APP EDITOR.
</ol>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This Mobile Application Snap4All has been developed to realize IOT/IOE Edge devices for smart city and Industry 4.0 applications, by <a href="https://www.disit.org">DISIT Lab</a> and for <a href="https://www.km4city.org">Km4City</a>, <a href="https://www.snap4city.org">Snap4City</a>.
    <br>
    The IOT Applications on Snap4All can exploit the sensors of the mobile phone, and may have a local users interface as local Dashboard. They may work as standalone solution sending messages to other IOT Devices and IOT Brokers as well as be connected to Snap4All, Snap4City, etc. platforms.
    <br>
    The App can be installed on android devices, and allow you to have an IOT Application into your mobile phone. The IOT application can be also produced into the mobile applications as well as developed on other facilities and imported.
    <br>
    The IOT Application and corresponding editor are based on NodeRED of JS Foundation licensed as <a href="https://github.com/node-red/node-red/blob/master/LICENSE">Apache License 2.0</a> , with some additions/improvements provided by Snap4City DISIT lab licensed as <a herf="https://github.com/disit/snap4city/blob/master/LICENSE"> Affero GPL license</a>.
    <br>
    Some of the innovative features that can be exploited into IOT applications are provided by Snap4City platform and can be mounted also on any NodeRED tool in any platform. Snap4City platform is 100% open source.
    <br>
    In addition, some of the features, as nodes, for the IOT Applications in NodeRED are specific for the Android platform. The mobile App Snap4All has been developed exploiting a number of libraries and tools known as Termux which is also licensed as <a href="https://github.com/roccomuso/termux/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT License 2017</a>.

    The source code of the Snap4All Mobile App can be accessed on github of DISIT Lab and it is released according to the above licenses for their respective aspects and components, and as Affero GPL for the Snap4All parts. Modified elements of former tools and libraries are released according to the source licenses.

<small>* is very likely that a toast 'starting node-red' is shown several times, this is normal since the operating system closes the server in order to save battery, termux-boot per&ograve; will try to restart it as soon as it is closed.
